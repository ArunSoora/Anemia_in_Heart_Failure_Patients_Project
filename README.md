# A Prospective Study: Prevalence and Treatment of Anemia in Heart Failure Patients

This repository contains the final PharmD research project focused on the evaluation and management of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with heart failure. The study was conducted using clinical diagnostics and patient monitoring methods.

## Project Summary

Iron-deficiency anemia is a common comorbidity in chronic heart failure and can worsen prognosis. This prospective study was conducted on over 100 patients using hematologic biomarkers (Hb, Ferritin, TSAT) and echocardiographic data to determine anemia severity and prevalence.

The research recommends tailored IV iron therapy and follow-up guidelines to improve 30-day medication adherence and reduce readmissions.

## Objectives

- Assess the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia among heart failure patients
- Evaluate correlations between lab findings and clinical symptoms
- Recommend evidence-based screening and treatment (IV iron protocols)

## Methodology

- **Sample Size**: 100+ heart failure patients
- **Diagnostics Used**: Hemoglobin, Ferritin, Transferrin Saturation (TSAT), and Echocardiography
- **Data Type**: Prospective cohort analysis
- **Outcomes Measured**:
  - Reduction in 30-day hospital readmissions
  - Improvement in medication adherence
  - Enhancement in clinical symptom management

## Key Results

- High prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia among heart failure patients
- IV iron supplementation significantly improved patient outcomes
- Proposed standard screening and IV iron protocols for broader application
